To interpret the details from your quantized model, let's break down the information you provided for each layer, focusing on the final layers as a key example.
Understanding the Model Structure

You have a model with layers arranged as follows based on your description:

    Input Layer: Receives 784 inputs (flattened 28x28 MNIST images).
    First Dense Layer (sequential/dense): Has 50 neurons.
    Second Dense Layer (sequential/dense_1): Has 20 neurons.
    Third Dense Layer (sequential/dense_2): Has 10 neurons.
    Output Dense Layer (sequential/dense_3): Has 10 neurons (corresponding to the 10 classes of MNIST digits).

Key Elements to Note

For each layer, especially the dense layers, you will have:

    Weights: Represented by MatMul in the tensor names.
    Biases: Represented by BiasAdd/ReadVariableOp in the tensor names.
    Quantized Scales and Zero Points: These help in converting the quantized integer values back to approximate floating-point values for understanding and operation in computations.

Example Analysis

Let's analyze one of the output layers (sequential/dense_3) to understand the quantized model:
Output Layer (sequential/dense_3)

    Biases (sequential/dense_3/BiasAdd/ReadVariableOp):
        Shape: [10] — This means there are 10 bias values, one for each output neuron.
        Quantized Scale: [0.00079298] — Each quantized value should be multiplied by this scale for interpretation.
        Quantized Zero Point: [0] — Indicates the base value for quantization.
        Tensor Values: These are the quantized integer representations of the biases.

    Example:

    plaintext

[-135, 216, -144, -20, 82, -159, -312, 124, 312, -12]

These values, once scaled, give the approximate floating-point bias values for each neuron in this layer.

Weights (sequential/dense_3/MatMul):

    Shape: [10, 10] — Indicates this layer connects 10 inputs to 10 outputs.
    Quantized Scale: [0.00709861] — Scale to multiply with quantized values to approximate the original floating-point weights.
    Tensor Values: The matrix of quantized integers representing the weights between neurons.

Example:

plaintext

    [[ -17, 56, -106, 95, -74, 16, -8, 55, -54, -17], ...]

    Each value here, once scaled, gives the approximate floating-point weight from one neuron to another.

General Interpretation Steps

    Multiply Quantized Values by Scale: To interpret the quantized values (either weights or biases), multiply each quantized integer by its respective scale.

    Add the Zero Point: If the zero point is not zero, adjust by adding it, but usually, for weights and biases, it remains zero.

    Use in Computations: These adjusted values approximate the original floating-point values and can be used to understand the model's behavior or for direct computation in specialized hardware that uses integers.

By following this approach, you can interpret each layer's parameters and understand how quantization affects the model's numerical representation and potentially its performance.
