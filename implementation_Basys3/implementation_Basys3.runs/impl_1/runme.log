Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
ERROR: [Place 30-415] IO Placement failed due to overutilization. This design contains 252 I/O ports
 while the target  device: 7z010i package: clg225, contains only 140 available user I/O. The target device has 140 usable I/O pins of which 0 are already occupied by user-locked I/Os.
 To rectify this issue:
 1. Ensure you are targeting the correct device and package.  Select a larger device or different package if necessary.
 2. Check the top-level ports of the design to ensure the correct number of ports are specified.
 3. Consider design changes to reduce the number of I/Os necessary.
